Cancer cells evade the attack of macrophages by liberating cytokines and enhancing the transition to the M2 phenotype with pro-tumoral functions. Despite this pernicious effect on immune systems, the M1 phenotype still exists in the environment and can eliminate tumor cells by liberating cytokines that recruit and activate the cytotoxic actions of TH1 effector cells.</description></item><item><title>MicroRNAs Regulate Metabolic Phenotypes During Multicellular Tumor Spheroids Progression</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/fontiers_oncology_2020_erick/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/fontiers_oncology_2020_erick/</guid><description>During tumor progression, cancer cells ire their metabolism to face their bioenergetic demands.

In cancer cells, EMT leads to drug resistance and metastasis. Moreover, differences in genetic backgrounds, even between patients with the same type of cancer, also determine resistance to some treatments. Metabolic rewiring is essential to induce EMT, hence it is important to identify key metabolic elements for this process, which can be later used to treat cancer cells with different genetic backgrounds.</description></item><item><title>Unveiling functional heterogeneity in breast cancer multicellular tumor spheroids through single-cell RNA-seq</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/scientificreports2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/scientificreports2020/</guid><description>Heterogeneity is an intrinsic characteristic of cancer.

Consequently, cancer is not a single disease but thousands. One property shared by all cancers is the ability to sustain chronic uncontrolled proliferation which raises the question how different cancers alter their metabolism in order to achieve consistent proliferation.
In this project we combine large-scale genomic data from DNA and RNA sequencing as well as proteomics and metabolomics to understand the connection between variations in the genotype and cancer metabolism.</description></item><item><title>Systems biology and bioinformatics of single cell RNAseq data.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/projects/singlecell_thelma/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/projects/singlecell_thelma/</guid><description>Research in personalized therapy has taken relevance because treatment failures due to intratumoral heterogenety which refers to celular diversity or subpopulations forming within the tumor.

The study of complex systems and their related phenomena has become a major research venue in the recent years and it is commonly regarded as an important part of the scientific revolution developing through the 21st century. The science of complexity is concerned with the laws of operation and evolution of systems formed by many locally interacting elements that produce collective order at spatiotemporal scales larger than that of the single constitutive elements.</description></item><item><title>Distinct microbes, metabolites, and ecologies define the microbiome in deficient and proficient mismatch repair colorectal cancers.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm30376889/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm30376889/</guid><description>Links between colorectal cancer (CRC) and the gut microbiome have been established, but the specific microbial species and their role in carcinogenesis remain an active area of inquiry.

Since the discovery of the Warburg effect in the 1920s cancer has been tightly associated with the genetic and metabolic state of the cell.

Unlike their free-living relatives, the metabolism of mutualistic endosymbionts and endosymbiont-originated organelles is specialized in the production of metabolites which are released to the host. This specialization suggests that natural selection crafted these metabolic adaptations. In this work, we analyzed the evolution of the metabolism of the chromatophore of Paulinella chromatophora by in silico modeling.</description></item><item><title>Personalized Prediction of Proliferation Rates and Metabolic Liabilities in Cancer Biopsies.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm28082911/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm28082911/</guid><description>Cancer is a heterogeneous disease and its genetic and metabolic mechanism may manifest differently in each patient.

In contrast to this idea, we postulate that cyclic attractors in certain cases could be a systemic mechanism to face the perturbations coming from the environment. To justify our conjecture, we present a dynamic analysis of a highly curated transcriptional regulatory network of macrophages constrained into a cancer microenvironment. We observed that when M1-associated transcription factors (STAT1 or NF-κB) are perturbed and the microenvironment balances to a hyper-inflammation condition, cycle attractors activate genes whose signals counteract this effect implicated in tissue damage.</description></item><item><title>Functional modules, structural topology, and optimal activity in metabolic networks.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm23071431/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm23071431/</guid><description>Modular organization in biological networks has been suggested as a natural mechanism by which a cell coordinates its metabolic strategies for evolving and responding to environmental perturbations.

Irrevocable evidence of this fact is the Warburg effect which establishes that cancer cells prefers glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. Regulatory action over metabolic enzymes has opened a new window for designing more effective anti-cancer treatments. This enterprise is not trivial and the development of computational models that contribute to identifying potential enzymes for breaking the robustness of cancer cells is a priority.</description></item><item><title>Filling kinetic gaps: dynamic modeling of metabolism where detailed kinetic information is lacking.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm19305506/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm19305506/</guid><description>Integrative analysis between dynamical modeling of metabolic networks and data obtained from high throughput technology represents a worthy effort toward a holistic understanding of the link among phenotype and dynamical response. Even though the theoretical foundation for modeling metabolic network has been extensively treated elsewhere, the lack of kinetic information has limited the analysis in most of the cases. To overcome this constraint, we present and illustrate a new statistical approach that has two purposes: integrate high throughput data and survey the general dynamical mechanisms emerging for a slightly perturbed metabolic network.</description></item><item><title>Regulation by transcription factors in bacteria: beyond description.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm19076632/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm19076632/</guid><description>Transcription is an essential step in gene expression and its understanding has been one of the major interests in molecular and cellular biology.

Gene regulation networks and metabolic pathways self-organize and reaccommodate to make the organism perform with stability and reliability under many point mutations, gene duplications and gene deletions. At the same time, living organisms are evolvable, which means that these kind of genetic perturbations can eventually make the organism acquire new functions and adapt to new environments. It is still an open problem to determine how robustness and evolvability blend together at the genetic level to produce stable organisms that yet can change and evolve.</description></item><item><title>Modular analysis of the transcriptional regulatory network of E. coli.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm15680508/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm15680508/</guid><description>The transcriptional network of Escherichia coli is currently the best-understood regulatory network of a single cell.
