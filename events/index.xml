The conference is expected to boost the new paradigm of interdisciplinary approaches converging into specific problems in biological physics.</description></item><item><title>3st International Summer Symposium on Systems Biology</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/events/is3b_2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/events/is3b_2019/</guid><description>Those are the proceedings for the 3rd edition of the “International Summer Symposium on Systems Biology”. The meeting took place at the National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN) in Mexico City from August 4-6, 2014. This event was the first of a series of meetings to encourage the development of the systems biology in Mexico and the development of this area to tackle basic and applied research in medical and biomedical fields.</description></item><item><title>Biological Physics Mexico City 2017</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/events/biological_physics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/events/biological_physics/</guid><description>Frontiers at the interface of Physics, Math and Biology. This conference (the second in a series) is intended as an international, multidisciplinary scientific forum to discuss the latest developments in biological physics (including proteins, peptides and enzymes, among many other topics).
The conference is expected to boost a new paradigm of interdisciplinary approaches converging into specific problems in biological physics. Hence, the conference audience is broad: We aim to attract the attention of biologists as well as biochemists, organic chemists, engineers, computational scientists, physicists, and mathematicians.</description></item><item><title>2nd International Summer Symposium on Systems Biology</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/events/is3b/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/events/is3b/</guid><description>With great pleasure we are hereby announcing the 2nd International Summer Symposium on Systems Biology (IS3B) taking place in Mexico City, Mexico from August 2nd - 4th 2016. The IS3B 2016 is organized by The Human Systems Biology Laboratory (HSBL), RAI-UNAM &amp;amp; INMEGEN.
The IS3B is currently the largest symposium on Systems Biology in Mexico and Latin America, and strives to unite leading researchers and students in an informal setting with the aim to present current research in Systems Biology and Systems Medicine.</description></item><item><title>1st International Summer Symposium on Systems Biology</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/events/is3b_2014/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/events/is3b_2014/</guid><description>Those are the proceedings for the 1st edition of the “International Summer Symposium on Systems Biology: From networks to phenotypes in human diseases”.
