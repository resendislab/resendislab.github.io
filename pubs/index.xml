Macrophages are essential immune cells that contribute to this balance constrained by the local signaling profile of the tumor microenvironment. To understand how pro- and anti-inflammatory unbalance emerges in cancer, we developed a theoretical analysis of macrophage differentiation that is derived from activated monocytes circulating in the blood. Once recruited to the site of inflammation, monocytes can be polarized based on the specific interleukins and chemokines in the microenvironment.</description></item><item><title>A network perspective on the ecology of gut microbiota and progression of type 2 diabetes: Linkages to keystone taxa in a Mexican cohort</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/mycrobiota_diabetes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/mycrobiota_diabetes/</guid><description>Introduction: The human gut microbiota (GM) is a dynamic system which ecological interactions among the community members affect the host metabolism.

Here, we used SparCC to infer association networks in 16S rRNA gene amplicon data from the GM of a cohort of Mexican patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in different stages: NG (normoglycemic), IFG (impaired fasting glucose), IGT (impaired glucose tolerance), IFG + IGT (impaired fasting glucose plus impaired glucose tolerance), T2D and T2D treated (T2D with a 5-year ongoing treatment).</description></item><item><title>Preprint: mb-PHENIX: Diffusion and Supervised Uniform Manifold Approximation for denoising microbiota data</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/mbphenix/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/mbphenix/</guid><description>Microbiota data suffers from technical noise (reflected as excess of zeros in the count matrix) and the curse of dimensionality. This complicates downstream data analysis and compromises the scientific discovery’s reliability. Data sparsity makes it difficult to obtain a well-cluster structure and distorts the abundance distributions. Currently, there is a rised need to develop new algorithms with improved capacities to reduce noise and recover missing information. We present mb-PHENIX, an open-source algorithm developed in Python, that recovers taxa abundances from the noisy and sparse microbiota data.</description></item><item><title>Comparative subcellular localization of NRF2 and KEAP1 during the hepatocellular carcinoma development in vivo</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/comparative_subcellular/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/comparative_subcellular/</guid><description>The activation of Nuclear Factor, Erythroid 2 Like 2 – Kelch Like ECH Associated Protein 1 (NRF2-KEAP1) signaling pathway plays a critical dual role by either protecting or promoting the carcinogenesis process. However, its activation or nuclear translocation during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression has not been addressed yet. This study characterizes the subcellular localization of both NRF2 and KEAP1 during diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in the rat. NRF2-KEAP1 pathway was continuously activated along with the increased expression of its target genes, namely Nqo1, Hmox1, Gclc, and Ptgr1.</description></item><item><title>Physiological Network Is Disrupted in Severe COVID-19</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/physiological_networks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/physiological_networks/</guid><description>The human body is a complex system maintained in homeostasis thanks to the interactions between multiple physiological regulation systems. When faced with physical or biological perturbations, this system must react by keeping a balance between adaptability and robustness. The SARS-COV-2 virus infection poses an immune system challenge that tests the organism’s homeostatic response. Notably, the elderly and men are particularly vulnerable to severe disease, poor outcomes, and death. Mexico seems to have more infected young men than anywhere else.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic Analysis of the RT-PCR Process in Single-Cell RNA-Seq</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/mathematics_2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/mathematics_2021/</guid><description>The single-cell RNA-seq allows exploring the transcriptome for one cell at a time. By doing so, cellular regulation is pictured. One limitation is the dropout events phenomenon, where a gene is observed at a low or moderate expression level in one cell but not detected in another. Dropouts obscure legitimate biological heterogeneity leading to the description of a small fraction of the meaningful relations. We used a stochastic approach to model the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) kinetic, in which we contemplated the temperature profile, RT-PCR duration, and reaction rates.</description></item><item><title>On Deep Landscape Exploration of COVID-19 Patients Cells and Severity Markers</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/frontiers_immunology_2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/frontiers_immunology_2021/</guid><description>COVID-19 is a disease with a spectrum of clinical responses ranging from moderate to critical. To study and control its effects, a large number of researchers are focused on two substantial aims. On the one hand, the discovery of diverse biomarkers to classify and potentially anticipate the disease severity of patients. These biomarkers could serve as a medical criterion to prioritize attention to those patients with higher prone to severe responses.</description></item><item><title>Transcriptional and Microenvironmental Landscape of Macrophage Transition in Cancer: A Boolean Analysis</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/frontiers_immunology_2021_ugo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/frontiers_immunology_2021_ugo/</guid><description>The balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune system responses is crucial to face and counteract complex diseases such as cancer. Macrophages are an essential population that contributes to this balance in collusion with the local tumor microenvironment. Cancer cells evade the attack of macrophages by liberating cytokines and enhancing the transition to the M2 phenotype with pro-tumoral functions. Despite this pernicious effect on immune systems, the M1 phenotype still exists in the environment and can eliminate tumor cells by liberating cytokines that recruit and activate the cytotoxic actions of TH1 effector cells.</description></item><item><title>MicroRNAs Regulate Metabolic Phenotypes During Multicellular Tumor Spheroids Progression</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/fontiers_oncology_2020_erick/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/fontiers_oncology_2020_erick/</guid><description>During tumor progression, cancer cells ire their metabolism to face their bioenergetic demands. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as regulatory elements that inhibit the translation and stability of crucial mRNAs, some of them causing direct metabolic alterations in cancer. In this study, we investigated the relationship between miRNAs and their targets mRNAs that control metabolism, and how this fine-tuned regulation is diversified depending on the tumor stage. To do so, we implemented a paired analysis of RNA-seq and small RNA-seq in a breast cancer cell line (MCF7).</description></item><item><title>Analysis of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Metabolism Identifies Possible Cancer Biomarkers Useful in Diverse Genetic Backgrounds</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/frontiers_onlogy2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/frontiers_onlogy2020/</guid><description>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) relates to many molecular and cellular alterations that occur when epithelial cells undergo a switch in differentiation generating mesenchymal-like cells with newly acquired migratory and invasive properties. In cancer cells, EMT leads to drug resistance and metastasis. Moreover, differences in genetic backgrounds, even between patients with the same type of cancer, also determine resistance to some treatments. Metabolic rewiring is essential to induce EMT, hence it is important to identify key metabolic elements for this process, which can be later used to treat cancer cells with different genetic backgrounds.</description></item><item><title>Unveiling functional heterogeneity in breast cancer multicellular tumor spheroids through single-cell RNA-seq</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/scientificreports2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/scientificreports2020/</guid><description>Heterogeneity is an intrinsic characteristic of cancer. Even in isogenic tumors, cell populations exhibit differential cellular programs that overall supply malignancy and decrease treatment efficiency. In this study, we investigated the functional relationship among cell subtypes and how this interdependency can promote tumor development in a cancer cell line. To do so, we performed single-cell RNA-seq of MCF7 Multicellular Tumor Spheroids as a tumor model. Analysis of single-cell transcriptomes at two-time points of the spheroid growth, allowed us to dissect their functional relationship.</description></item><item><title>Memote: A community driven effort towards a standardized genome-scale metabolic model test suite</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/memote/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/memote/</guid><description>Several studies have shown that neither the formal representation nor the functional requirements of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are precisely defined. Without a consistent standard, comparability, reproducibility, and interoperability of models across groups and software tools cannot be guaranteed. Here, we present memote (https://github.com/opencobra/memote) an open-source software containing a community-maintained, standardized set of metabolic model tests. The tests cover a range of aspects from annotations to conceptual integrity and can be extended to include experimental datasets for automatic model validation.</description></item><item><title>Micom: metagenome-scale modeling to infer metabolic interactions in the microbiota.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/micom/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/micom/</guid><description>Alterations in the gut microbiota have been associated with a variety of medical conditions such as obesity, Crohn&amp;rsquo;s disease and diabetes. However, establishing the causality between the microbial composition and disease remains a challenge. We introduce a strategy based on metabolic models of complete microbial gut communities in order to derive the particular metabolic consequences of the microbial composition for the diabetic gut in a balanced cohort of 186 individuals. By using a heuristic optimization approach based on L2 regularization we were able to obtain a unique set of realistic growth rates that allows growth for the majority of observed taxa in a sample.</description></item><item><title>Cancer: a complex disease</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/cancer_a_complex_disease/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/cancer_a_complex_disease/</guid><description>This is an EBook can be downloaded for free.
The study of complex systems and their related phenomena has become a major research venue in the recent years and it is commonly regarded as an important part of the scientific revolution developing through the 21st century. The science of complexity is concerned with the laws of operation and evolution of systems formed by many locally interacting elements that produce collective order at spatiotemporal scales larger than that of the single constitutive elements.</description></item><item><title>Distinct microbes, metabolites, and ecologies define the microbiome in deficient and proficient mismatch repair colorectal cancers.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm30376889/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm30376889/</guid><description>Links between colorectal cancer (CRC) and the gut microbiome have been established, but the specific microbial species and their role in carcinogenesis remain an active area of inquiry. Our understanding would be enhanced by better accounting for tumor subtype, microbial community interactions, metabolism, and ecology. We collected paired colon tumor and normal-adjacent tissue and mucosa samples from 83 individuals who underwent partial or total colectomies for CRC. Mismatch repair (MMR) status was determined in each tumor sample and classified as either deficient MMR (dMMR) or proficient MMR (pMMR) tumor subtypes.</description></item><item><title>Synthesis of multi-omic data and community metabolic models reveals insights into the role of hydrogen sulfide in colon cancer.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm29704665/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm29704665/</guid><description>Multi-omic data and genome-scale microbial metabolic models have allowed us to examine microbial communities, community function, and interactions in ways that were not available to us historically. Now, one of our biggest challenges is determining how to integrate data and maximize data potential. Our study demonstrates one way in which to test a hypothesis by combining multi-omic data and community metabolic models. Specifically, we assess hydrogen sulfide production in colorectal cancer based on stool, mucosa, and tissue samples collected on and off the tumor site within the same individuals.</description></item><item><title>Quantitative Models for Microscopic to Macroscopic Biological Macromolecules and Tissues</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/quantitative_modeling/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/quantitative_modeling/</guid><description>This book presents cutting-edge research on the use of physical and mathematical formalisms to model and quantitatively analyze biological phenomena ranging from microscopic to macroscopic systems.

Since the discovery of the Warburg effect in the 1920s cancer has been tightly associated with the genetic and metabolic state of the cell. One of the hallmarks of cancer is the alteration of the cellular metabolism in order to promote proliferation and undermine cellular defense mechanisms such as apoptosis or detection by the immune system.</description></item><item><title>Editorial: Systems Biology and the Challenge of Deciphering the Metabolic Mechanisms Underlying Cancer</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/editorial_frontiers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2017 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/editorial_frontiers/</guid><description>This is the Editorial for our Frontiers Research Topic &amp;ldquo;Systems Biology and the challenge of deciphering the metabolic mechanisms underlying cancer&amp;rdquo;.

This specialization suggests that natural selection crafted these metabolic adaptations.

In contrast to this idea, we postulate that cyclic attractors in certain cases could be a systemic mechanism to face the perturbations coming from the environment. To justify our conjecture, we present a dynamic analysis of a highly curated transcriptional regulatory network of macrophages constrained into a cancer microenvironment. We observed that when M1-associated transcription factors (STAT1 or NF-κB) are perturbed and the microenvironment balances to a hyper-inflammation condition, cycle attractors activate genes whose signals counteract this effect implicated in tissue damage.</description></item><item><title>Functional modules, structural topology, and optimal activity in metabolic networks.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm23071431/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm23071431/</guid><description>Modular organization in biological networks has been suggested as a natural mechanism by which a cell coordinates its metabolic strategies for evolving and responding to environmental perturbations.

In this work, we combined metabolome data and constraint-based modeling to elucidate the relationships among structural modules, functional organization, and the optimal metabolic phenotype of Rhizobium etli, a bacterium that fixes nitrogen in symbiosis with Phaseolus vulgaris.</description></item><item><title>Systems biology of bacterial nitrogen fixation: high-throughput technology and its integrative description with constraint-based modeling.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm21801415/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm21801415/</guid><description>Bacterial nitrogen fixation is the biological process by which atmospheric nitrogen is uptaken by bacteroids located in plant root nodules and converted into ammonium through the enzymatic activity of nitrogenase. In practice, this biological process serves as a natural form of fertilization and its optimization has significant implications in sustainable agricultural programs. Currently, the advent of high-throughput technology supplies with valuable data that contribute to understanding the metabolic activity during bacterial nitrogen fixation.</description></item><item><title>Proteomic patterns of cervical cancer cell lines, a network perspective.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm21696634/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm21696634/</guid><description>Cervical cancer is a major mortality factor in the female population. This neoplastic is an excellent model for studying the mechanisms involved in cancer maintenance, because the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the etiology factor in most cases. With the purpose of characterizing the effects of malignant transformation in cellular activity, proteomic studies constitute a reliable way to monitor the biological alterations induced by this disease. In this contextual scheme, a systemic description that enables the identification of the common events between cell lines of different origins, is required to distinguish the essence of carcinogenesis.</description></item><item><title>Modeling core metabolism in cancer cells: surveying the topology underlying the Warburg effect.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm20811631/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm20811631/</guid><description>Alterations on glucose consumption and biosynthetic activity of amino acids, lipids and nucleotides are metabolic changes for sustaining cell proliferation in cancer cells. Irrevocable evidence of this fact is the Warburg effect which establishes that cancer cells prefers glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. Regulatory action over metabolic enzymes has opened a new window for designing more effective anti-cancer treatments. This enterprise is not trivial and the development of computational models that contribute to identifying potential enzymes for breaking the robustness of cancer cells is a priority.</description></item><item><title>Filling kinetic gaps: dynamic modeling of metabolism where detailed kinetic information is lacking.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm19305506/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm19305506/</guid><description>Integrative analysis between dynamical modeling of metabolic networks and data obtained from high throughput technology represents a worthy effort toward a holistic understanding of the link among phenotype and dynamical response. Even though the theoretical foundation for modeling metabolic network has been extensively treated elsewhere, the lack of kinetic information has limited the analysis in most of the cases. To overcome this constraint, we present and illustrate a new statistical approach that has two purposes: integrate high throughput data and survey the general dynamical mechanisms emerging for a slightly perturbed metabolic network.</description></item><item><title>Regulation by transcription factors in bacteria: beyond description.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm19076632/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm19076632/</guid><description>Transcription is an essential step in gene expression and its understanding has been one of the major interests in molecular and cellular biology. By precisely tuning gene expression, transcriptional regulation determines the molecular machinery for developmental plasticity, homeostasis and adaptation. In this review, we transmit the main ideas or concepts behind regulation by transcription factors and give just enough examples to sustain these main ideas, thus avoiding a classical ennumeration of facts.</description></item><item><title>Metabolic reconstruction and modeling of nitrogen fixation in Rhizobium etli.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm17922569/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm17922569/</guid><description>Rhizobiaceas are bacteria that fix nitrogen during symbiosis with plants. This symbiotic relationship is crucial for the nitrogen cycle, and understanding symbiotic mechanisms is a scientific challenge with direct applications in agronomy and plant development. Rhizobium etli is a bacteria which provides legumes with ammonia (among other chemical compounds), thereby stimulating plant growth. A genome-scale approach, integrating the biochemical information available for R. etli, constitutes an important step toward understanding the symbiotic relationship and its possible improvement.</description></item><item><title>Identification of regulatory network topological units coordinating the genome-wide transcriptional response to glucose in Escherichia coli.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm17559662/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jun 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm17559662/</guid><description>Glucose is the preferred carbon and energy source for Escherichia coli.

Gene regulation networks and metabolic pathways self-organize and reaccommodate to make the organism perform with stability and reliability under many point mutations, gene duplications and gene deletions. At the same time, living organisms are evolvable, which means that these kind of genetic perturbations can eventually make the organism acquire new functions and adapt to new environments. It is still an open problem to determine how robustness and evolvability blend together at the genetic level to produce stable organisms that yet can change and evolve.</description></item><item><title>Modular analysis of the transcriptional regulatory network of E. coli.</title><link>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm15680508/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resendislab.github.io/pubs/pm15680508/</guid><description>The transcriptional network of Escherichia coli is currently the best-understood regulatory network of a single cell. Motivated by statistical evidence, suggesting a hierarchical modular architecture in this network, we identified eight modules with well-defined physiological functions. These modules were identified by a clustering approach, using the shortest path to trace regulatory relationships across genes in the network. We report the type (feed forward and bifan) and distribution of motifs between and within modules.</description></item></channel></rss>
